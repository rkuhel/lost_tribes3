The brewing process is that of a traditional British Pale Ale, with a German-influenced New York twist. Spices of Chinook, Noble German Spalter, and citrus-like Cascade hops yield a balance and an experience unparalleled by any other beer. Recovered from the tribe of Judah whose family traveled through Babylon to North America before returning to the homeland.</p>

                Lost Tribes’ Light is cold brewed and cold aged to perfection in a unique brewing process. The choice of using only the finest Pale and Munich malts makes this a LOW-CALORIE knockout that’s refreshingly tasty all by itself or as a partner with any meal. Subtly hopped in traditional German style, this delicious lager’s explosive flavor will have you second guessing whether you're really drinking a low-calorie brew.
                "Inspired by the Tribe of Benjamin some of whom traveled with Judah before returning to the homeland."</p>

              <div class="bfeatures" id="tejdiv"><img src="./../LostTribes-tejbottle.png" class="tejpic" id="sliders"/><h4><span class = "beertitle">Tej</span></h4><p>Our ancient style brew, described as "the drink of kings," is fermented with all natural wildflower honey and spicy gesho herbs. Myth claims the recipe was a gift from The Queen of Sheeba to King Solomon during his reign in the 9th century BCE. Gesho is traditionally used like hops for the preparation and flavoring of beverages. As you indulge in this sweet gingery nectar, you will be surprised by the pleasant bitterness of the gesho. As you peel back layers of the Tej, you’ll taste hints of coriander, citrus fruit, licorice, and heather flowers. Best when served chilled.
                Preserved from the Tribe of Dan who journeyed through Ethiopia before returning home.</p>
